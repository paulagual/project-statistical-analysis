## Project Description

Analyse statisticaly the Big Mac Index (The Economist) versus a different number of indicators of each country from the Data World Bank.

<a name="dataset"></a>

## Dataset

I will be using 2 datasets:
- Big Mac Index "The Economist": https://github.com/TheEconomist/big-mac-data
- Economic data from countries "Data World Bank": https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators

<a name="workflow"></a>

## Workflow

### Find a dataset
* I 'easily' found the Big Mac Index
* For the economic data it was much more difficult
* I tried different datasets, but not updated or with very low information.
* Finally I chosed the one from the Data World Bank, with a lot of economic indicators from 2016.

### Cleaning and setting the data
* I spent a little bit of the time of the project cleaning the data set, but mainly preparing the economic data to merge with the Big Mac Index.

### Statistical analysis

## Obstacles

As the last project I found difficult to be able to find my own objective into the data, as the project is open and the possibilities are infinite, this time I started with an objective and then search for the Data. Wich I found Much Much more difficult.

## Lessons Learned

* I have learned to choose more wisely a dataset. I thought I already learned that point, but obliusly I did not.
